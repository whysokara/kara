There’s something oddly satisfying about resetting a device and setting it up from scratch. The blank screen, the default settings, it’s like you’re starting fresh. Wiping it clean, starting over, setting it up exactly how you want—effects, shortcuts, dark mode (because, obviously, light mode is for the brave), adjusting the mouse speed, setting up those custom keyboard shortcuts and finger gestures. Deciding what should be pinned on the dock and all. It’s oddly therapeutic.

But here’s the thing: when you do a factory reset, you’re not just setting things up again. You’re clearing out the junk, old cache files, errors, all the clutter you didn’t even know was slowing things down. It’s cleaner, faster, lighter.

Life?
We carry our own baggage, our "cache memory." Old arguments, bad habits, unresolved feelings! they sit there, quietly taking up space, slowing us down.

We hoard stuff.. old photos, to-do lists from last year, weird memories that pop up at 2 a.m., things we never really needed but somehow held on to. It all sits there, in the background, slowing us down. Imagine if we could clear it out. Like decluttering a drawer or cleaning out a closet, but for the mind. I mean, how much of what we carry is actually useful?

It’s funny, though. No matter how many resets you do, there’s always one thing you forget to set up until you need it. Like when you open an app and realize you forgot your login details. Or you’re midway through work and notice your favorite shortcut isn’t configured yet. It’s annoying, sure. But it’s also a reminder that even after a fresh start, you’re still figuring it out as you go.

Starting over isn’t about forgetting; it’s about letting go. Clearing out the unnecessary so there’s room to focus on what really matters.
