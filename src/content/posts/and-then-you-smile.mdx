You’re in a cab, stuck in traffic, staring at your watch. The flight is in 90 minutes, and you haven’t even reached the airport. You glance at the clock again and again, each passing minute tightening the knot in your stomach. You picture the long check-in queue, the security checks, and the boarding gate far, far away. Your mind is racing what if you miss it? What if you have to buy another ticket? What if this messes up everything? The cab driver isn’t helping either usko bhi petrol tabhi bharwana tha. But somehow, you make it. You dash through the airport, the security line magically moves faster than usual, and you reach the gate just as they call for boarding. As you settle into your seat, exhausted, you replay the chaos in your head… and then you smile.

Or that one time when you were hosting guests at home, and just before they arrived, the power went out. The fan stopped, the AC died, and the room turned into a sauna. You panicked ki kaisa lagega? What would they think? Just as their car pulled up, the power came back like nothing ever happened. You laughed awkwardly through the evening, pretending everything was under control, but later, sitting alone, you thought about those tense minutes… and then you smiled.

And then there’s the time it was the last day to file your ITR, or that college assignment you left for the last hour. You were scrambling to gather documents, practicing fake signature, typing furiously, and praying the internet didn’t suddenly stop working. It felt like the universe was against you, but somehow, you managed to hit “Submit” just in time. Later, Hours later, as the adrenaline fades, you remember the sheer chaos of it all… and you smile.

It’s funny how our minds love to run wild, imagining every worst-case scenario like we’re in some disaster movie. Every ticking second feels heavier, every problem seems too big to solve. But then, life has this sneaky way of sorting itself out. The chaos fades, things come together, and what felt impossible just minutes ago becomes a story you laugh about later.

Until, of course, it happens again. Like when you’re traveling and need to poop badly. But that’s a story for another time.
