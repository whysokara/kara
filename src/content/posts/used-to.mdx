"Used to" is a bit like that party guest who overstays their welcome. At first, they’re fun, bringing all the good vibes, but after a while, they’re just hanging around, making everything feel ordinary. Think about it: "used to" might just be the sneakiest phrase out there. It has this quiet, almost sinister way of showing up in our lives, whether we like it or not. 

One minute, you're over the moon with excitement about your new phone—after all, you’ve saved for months!—and the next thing you know, you're casually tossing it onto the couch like it's nothing special. How does that happen? 
We get *used to* things. "Used to" creeps in and turns the shiny into the ordinary.

It's not just material things either. Think about relationships. You get so used to someone’s presence that when they leave or pass away, the initial sting is sharp, but eventually, you adjust. You learn to live without them, and life goes on—strange as it may sound.

It doesn’t stop there. This "getting used to" invades every corner of life. That fancy new job? Give it a month, and Monday mornings are the same old grind. That dream vacation? By day five, you're wondering if the hotel pillows are secretly filled with rocks.

Jo bhi hai reflecting on it all, maybe 'used to' isn’t the villain after all. Like a comfy pair of jeans, it allows you to move freely and embrace new adventures. Sure, the shine fades, but that just makes room for the next great thing. So, embrace "used to"—it's proof you've mastered one chapter and are ready for the next.
