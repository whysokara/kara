As kids, most of us never truly chose what we liked or disliked. Life chose for us. If money was tight, we told ourselves we didn’t care about fancy shoes, branded clothes, or expensive watches. If we grew up in a small town with no fine dining or malls, we convinced ourselves those things weren’t for us. Saying, “That’s not my style” was easier than admitting it was never an option.

Bit by bit, our preferences weren’t shaped by who we were, but by what was possible. You believed you liked plain clothes because that’s all you had access to. You decided big birthdays weren’t your thing, maybe because they were a luxury, maybe because you never saw one around you. You claimed roadside stalls made the best food, not because you tasted the world, but because restaurants simply didn’t exist where you lived.

What started as a coping mechanism became an identity. A quiet pride grew in being low-maintenance, in not asking for much. Even when life changed.. when you could afford more, when the world opened up you stuck to the script. Not because you had to, but because it felt safe.
But what if you looked again?

What if you walked into that store you used to avoid, not to buy, just to feel? What if you tried on a watch you once never dared touch, not to show anyone, but to see how it felt against your skin? What if you booked a holiday, made a dinner reservation, not because you need it, but just to see?

Maybe you’ll hate it all. Maybe your love for simple things wasn’t a defence mechanism, it was truly you. But maybe! just maybe!! you’ll realize you do love that soft leather jacket. You do like having five pairs of shoes. You do want to sit in a room with tall windows and soft sheets, not for show, but because it makes you happy in ways you never gave yourself permission to experience.

The point isn’t to become someone else. It’s to finally meet the version of you that chooses freely.
