There was a time when ₹100 could buy you a full meal, a rickshaw ride, and maybe a plate of momos with enough left for a Metro ride. Today? It’s gone in a blink like your weekend.

We call it inflation. Prices go up, value goes down. We get it.<br/>
But what about time inflation?

But there’s another kind nobody’s talking about: time inflation.

24 hours used to be enough. You could work, chill, meet a friend, eat dinner without scrolling, maybe even read something that wasn’t a screen. Now? You wake up, blink twice, and it’s already 5:17 PM and you’re behind on five things.

Three hours of your day vanish commuting. Another hour disappears planning a “simple” birthday party. What used to be cake and friends is now mood boards, aesthetic cafes, outfit changes, 500 photos, and a reel you’ll edit for 2 weeks and still not post.

We’ve never had more “productivity tools” and yet we’ve never felt more out of time.
Even buying shoes is a whole process: open 12 tabs, compare 6 brands, read 20 reviews, check influencers' opinions and you still end up returning them. That’s time inflation.

There’s no RBI to control this. No time tax policy. No limit on how many hours you’re allowed to lose trying to find the perfect brunch spot. No alert that says: “You’ve spent 11 minutes re-reading the same WhatsApp message”

Nobody tracks this loss. It’s not in your bank statement or your health report. But it’s happening quietly, every single day.

If time was money, most of us are going broke. <br/>
And worst part? We don’t even know who’s spending it.
