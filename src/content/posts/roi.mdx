When you think of things that offer the highest return on investment (ROI), what comes to mind? A smart stock, a profitable business deal, or maybe the latest gadget that saves you hours of work? Those are good guesses, but here’s something that beats them all, something so simple yet it pays back for a lifetime.

It’s gifting something to a child.

Picture this: you give a child a small gift. Maybe a soft toy, car or even a little puzzle ya kuch bhi yaar. At first, it seems like no big deal, but to the child, it’s magic. They light up. They remember. And here’s the beautiful part, they start recognising you, tumko pehchan-ne lagte hai. They might not know your name, but they’ll know your face, tumhare paas aane lagte hai. "Oh, that’s the person who gave me this!". Every time someone visits their home, they’ll proudly show off your gift and tell them you gave it. You become part of their little world, their stories, their memories.

Now let me share my story. My mama gave me a purple scooter on my first birthday. It wasn’t fancy, but it stayed with me for years. Even today, I vividly remember it. I may not have the scooter anymore, but I still have the pictures of me riding it, the memories of it in the background of family photos, and the stories I tell about it. That gift wasn’t just a toy; it was a connection, something that tied us together in an unforgettable way.

The real beauty of gifting a child something is that it doesn’t need to be big or expensive. It’s the thought, the moment, and the bond it creates that matter. What you give might fade, but the feeling it creates doesn’t. And here’s the most heartwarming part, it’s not just the child who carries those memories, you do too. When they smile at you, tell others about you, or even mention that little gift in passing, you’ll feel the warmth of that small gesture paying off in ways no stock or deal ever could. That’s what makes it the highest ROI.
