Both movies and startups begin with a pitch, burn through cash faster than you can say "Series A," and pray for a blockbuster exit. The difference? In Hollywood, the script is finished before filming. In startups, it's rewritten daily.

Directors yell "Cut!" Founders yell "Pivot!" 

Both are banking on that perfect ensemble cast, but one calls them actors, the other "co-founders who'll work for equity."

And remember, whether it's box office or user acquisition, the numbers are always slightly exaggerated.

In the end, they're both chasing unicorns. One's CGI, the other's a $1B valuation.

Fade to IPO.
